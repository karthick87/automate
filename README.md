# RPM Automation Test Case
- This is a test case from RPM Automation.
- When someone pushes an update to a Git repository, it notify's Jenkins of the update.
- Jenkins pulls the update into its own clone of the Git repository.
- The build process compiles all the source artefacts.
- And finally the results are packaged in a RPM file.
